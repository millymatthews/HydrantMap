### Map Script
The map is created by the `hydrants.js` file, which is called by `map.html`. This script loads the hydrant data, which is fetched as GeoJSON from the City of Cambridge GIS Data Dictionary. A users device location is determined and panned to. A buffer about the centre of the map is computed using the Turf.JS buffer function. Data is plotted on the map using the LeafletJS GeoJSON function, within the buffer.

### Data
Hydrant data was sourced from the [City of Cambridge GIS Data Dictionary](https://www.cambridgema.gov/GIS/gisdatadictionary/Infra/INFRA_Hydrants).

### Building Documentation

`hydrants.js` is documented using JSDoc in-line comments, and includes this read-me file. Documentation generated by JSDoc is in the `docs/' folder


To build documentation run:
```sh
$ jsdoc scripts -R README.md -d docs
```
